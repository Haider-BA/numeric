MATRIX MULTIPLICATION BENCHMARK
===============================
This benchmark aims to test the computational speed of a simple matrix
multiplication in double precision of square matrices.

The code written should be stripped of comments, but be written in a clear 
syntax that feels natural for the language, in a coding style that is felt as
good practice.

The program must check that the matrix width/height has been given as a command
line argument, and exit with an error of the string "Sorry, I need matrix width 
as command line argument", if not given.

All codes must produce the following matrices, when given the command line 
argument '2':

    A = [[2.0  2.0]
         [2.0  2.0]]

    B = [[0.0  2.0]
         [1.0  3.0]]

    C = [[2.0 10.0]
         [2.0 10.0]]

The programs should not display this output, but should be validated during 
development.
